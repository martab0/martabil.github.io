# Cleaning the exterior

Wash the exterior with soapy water and a sponge, then dry it off with a chamois.

Air pollution, rain, mud and traffic film will make the vehicle exterior dirty.

Retain the new appearance of the vehicle by cleaning it regularly and applying BMC car polish.

**üìù Note:** Keep the hand brake fully on when using high pressure water washing to avoid wetting the brakes.

- Wash the exterior of the vehicle frequently using a soft sponge and plenty of water containing a mild detergent.
- Soften large deposits of mud first with water before using the sponge.
- Remove smears by a second wash using clean water.
- When dry, wipe the surface of the car using a damp chamois leather.
- Remove spots of grease or tar using petrol/white spirit (gasoline/hydrocarbon solvent).
- If the car is driven in extreme conditions such as sea spray or on salted roads, hose the under-body of the vehicle.
