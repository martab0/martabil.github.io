# Cleaning the woodwork - Traveller

Clean and varnish the exterior woodwork with care.

The woodwork on the exterior of the car is varnished.

- Wash the woodwork regularly using water with a small amount of detergent.
- Ensure the varnish is thoroughly dry after washing. Pay particular attention to the joints in the woodwork.
- Re-varnish the woodwork annually using the BMC recommended varnish. Before re-varnishing, sand the woodwork with 320 grade wet-and-dry sandpaper, used dry.
