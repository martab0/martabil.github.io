# Cleaning the exterior trim

Gently clean the exterior trim and apply grease to preserve the finish.

**‚ùóÔ∏è CAUTION:** Never use an abrasive cleaner on stainless steel, chrome, aluminium or plastic trim.

**üìù Note:** Don't clean plastic trim with metal polish.

Any sligh tarnish found on stainless steel or plated trim that has not received regular washing can be removed with BMC Chrome Cleaner.

Occasional application of mineral light oil or grease will help to preserve the finish of the trim, particularly during winter when salt might be used on the roads. Don't apply these protectives to plastic trim.

- Remove spots of grease and tar with petrol/white spirit (gasoline/hydrocarbon solvent).
- Wash with water containing a mild detergent.
- When all dirt is removed, polish with a clean, dry cloth or chamoise leather.
